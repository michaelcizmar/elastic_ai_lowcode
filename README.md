## Installation

This project combines various projects so the installation reflects those individual components

### Elastic Stack
I've included a docker compose in the form that we use frequently.  It is based on Elastic's template but it also includes Elastic's Enterprise node which is required for doing web crawls. 

If you do not want that, you can use Elastic's script:
```
$ curl -fsSL https://elastic.co/start-local | sh
```

Otherwise, you can make a copy of .env.example, modify and run:

```
$ docker compose up
```

from the root directory of this project.

### Dify

Dify requires a few services and the project updates frequently so it is recommended to clone that seperately and run it. 
```
$ git clone https://github.com/langgenius/dify.git
$ cd dify
$ cd docker
$ cp .env.example .env
$ docker compose up -d
```

### Ollama

Ollama ideally will be installed locally versus Docker.  Follow the instructions to do so.

Macos  - [download](https://ollama.com/download/Ollama-darwin.zip)
Windows - [download](https://ollama.com/download/OllamaSetup.exe)
Linux - Run this script:
```
curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh
```
