# Chat with a product sheet

This example uses a product sheet as the context supplied to a link or a file upload.  The product sheet is converted into text and
sent to the LLM for processing.  In this example, it's been configured to use Ollama's Llama 3.2 [default model](https://ollama.com/library/llama3.2).
